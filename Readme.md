This shell script monitors a specified log file for new entries in real-time and performs basic analysis on the log entries.
It provides a simple framework for monitoring and analyzing log data.


To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `logfile` variable in the script to specify the path to your log file.
2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
./log_monitor.sh


# Description::

Monitor Log File Function
The monitor_log_file() function continuously monitors the specified log file for new entries using the tail -f command.
It reads each new log entry and echoes it to the console.

Analyze Log Entry Function
The analyze_log_entry() function performs basic analysis on each log entry.
Currently, it counts the occurrences of the word "error" in the log entry using grep -c.

Signal Handling
The script traps the SIGINT signal (usually generated by pressing Ctrl+C) using the trap command.
When the signal is received, it kills the background monitoring process, displays a message indicating that monitoring has stopped, and exits gracefully.
